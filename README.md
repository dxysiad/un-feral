# FERAL

FERAL is an open-source toolkit for supervised animal behavior segmentation that leverages state-of-the-art video-understanding models.

- No pose estimation
- Install and start training in 3 commands
- Scale a small set of manual labels to terabytes of video

## Quickest Start (Google Colab)

The easiest way to run FERAL is directly in your browser through Google Colab, but you'll need a Colab Pro subscription to access good GPUs. Good news: Colab Pro is free for academics with an institutional email.

[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wPe7MX3IiY3zsFkeTzLzHgynrtj-wXFP)

> Use with an A100 or L4 GPU.

## Manual Installation

```
pip install feral
```

That's it. Now you should be able to run everything.

### System Requirements

- Preferably Linux. Windows should work too. We haven't tested on Mac.
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.5+ (with a compatible CUDA version)
- NVIDIA GPU with Ampere architecture or newer (compute capability 8.0+) and 24+ GB VRAM. FERAL uses bfloat16 and flash attention, which require newer architectures.

> If PyTorch 2.5 is awkward to get in your environment, **2.4 works for everything except the VideoPrism backbones** (which need `torch.nn.attention.flex_attention`, added in 2.5). The V-JEPA backbones run fine on 2.4.

> Older GPUs like V100 (Volta) and T4 (Turing) — including free Google Colab T4 instances — will **not** work. Supported GPUs include: A100, H100, A10, L4, L40, RTX 3000/4000/5000 series, and newer.

### Windows Notes

- `triton-windows` is installed automatically as a drop-in replacement for the official `triton` package, which has no Windows build.
- **PyTorch 2.8-2.9 has a known bug on Windows** where `torch.compile` crashes with `OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long` ([pytorch#162430](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/162430)). Use PyTorch 2.7 or 2.10+ to avoid this. See [issue #11](https://github.com/Skovorp/feral/issues/11) for details.

We've used RunPod extensively to run experiments. It's very easy to set up.

### Troubleshooting

- **V-JEPA 2.1 backbone download fails with `URLError: [Errno 111] Connection refused`.** Upstream's `facebookresearch/vjepa2` `torch.hub` repo currently ships a leftover test URL (`VJEPA_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8300"`). Point it back at the public CDN in the cached copy:
  ```
  sed -i 's|http://localhost:8300|https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/vjepa2|' \
    ~/.cache/torch/hub/facebookresearch_vjepa2_main/src/hub/backbones.py
  ```
  This only affects the `vjepa2_1_*` (V-JEPA 2.1) backbones.

## Running FERAL

### 1. Re-encode Videos

FERAL needs videos in a format that supports random frame access, so we recommend re-encoding your videos with the provided tool. It will install FFmpeg if it doesn't find it on your system.

```
feral reencode path/to/videos path/for/reencoded/videos
```

### 2. Start Training

```
feral train path/to/videos path/to/labels
```

This will prompt you about logging options — you can select what fits you. You'll be able to see per-epoch metrics either way. If you select W&B, you'll also get automatically generated ethograms, per-step loss, and system utilization info.

Results will be saved to `answers/_inference_{run_name}_{timestamp}.json`.

### 3. Training from a Config

If you don't want to run this in an interactive terminal, you can start training with:

```
feral train-config path/to/config
```

This requires a config in the same format as the packaged `feral/default_config.yaml`.

### 4. Inference

You can run inference through the train command by removing the train partition from your config. But you can also run inference standalone without a config:

```
feral infer path/to/checkpoint path/to/videos
```

## Example Datasets

FERAL has been validated on multiple datasets:

- **CalMS21** - mouse social interactions
- **MaBE** - multi-species benchmark (mice, beetles, ants, flies)
- **C. elegans** - locomotor states (forward/reverse/turn/pause)
- **Ooceraea biroi** - self vs. allogrooming and collective raids
